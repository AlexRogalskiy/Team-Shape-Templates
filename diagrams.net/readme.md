# draw.io / diagrams.net

The [TeamTopologies.xml](TeamTopologies.xml) is used to create a Library with several shapes. The shapes are named - hover over a shape to see the description.

#### Usage

You have a couple of options, simply click the following link to pre-load the library:

- [Open Draw.io with the Team Topologies Shape Libray](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&ui=min&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2f%2fraw.githubusercontent.com%2fTeamTopologies%2fTeam-Shape-Templates%2fmaster%2fdiagrams.net%2fTeamTopologies.xml)

Or

* Download _[TeamTopologies.xml](TeamTopologies.xml)_ from this repository
* Open diagrams.net in a browser
* File -> Open Library from -> Device
* Select the file _TeamTopologies.xml_

A new shape library should appear.
