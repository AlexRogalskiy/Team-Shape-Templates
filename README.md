# Team Shape Templates

Templates for popular drawing and diagramming tools to represent the team types and team interaction modes in Team Topologies.

Based on some of the ideas in the book _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable).
